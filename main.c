TERMS SECTION
/*
Deadlock - a situation on which a thread enters a waiting state, waiting for some resource to become available, for indefinite amount of time. 
reasons that cause a deadlock: 
01) the same thread tries to lock the same mutex twice. (the first lock will work, but the second one will cause it to wait for ever since he is the one holding the lock.)
